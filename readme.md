Client Side Rendering Vs Server Side Rendering

Client Side Rendering (CSR)

- In CSR, the server sends a minimal HTML document to the browser.
- The browser then requests for the JavaScript file which contains the logic to render the page.
- The JavaScript file is executed in the browser and it makes an API call to fetch the data.
- The data is then rendered in the browser.

Server Side Rendering (SSR)

- In SSR, the server sends a fully rendered HTML document to the browser.
- The browser receives the fully rendered HTML document and displays it.

Advantages of SSR

- Better SEO: Search engines can crawl the content of the page easily.
- Faster Time to Content: The browser receives the fully rendered HTML document and displays it immediately.
